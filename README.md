# horiseon-refactoring

[horiseon-Site] (https://morideaux.github.io/horiseon-refactoring-week-1-challange/)

## Objective:
refactoring the horiseon site to provide greater accesability and clarity to useres utilizing a screen reader. Additionally making the code easier to navigate for new individuls.

Refactoring helps make code and design elements more clear, concise, and comprehensible. This is better than leaving these elements vauge due to the fact that it would provide issues to usuers and coders alike; this could result in reduced site traffic which would be counter intuitive for a search engine optimization company.
